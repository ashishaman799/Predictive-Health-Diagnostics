# Predictive Health Diagnostics
Overview
"Predictive Health Diagnostics" is a comprehensive web application designed to predict the likelihood of various diseases using advanced machine learning algorithms. The project focuses on heart disease, diabetes, and Parkinson's disease. The application provides an intuitive interface for users to input their health parameters and receive immediate predictions.

Features
Heart Disease Prediction:

Utilizes a machine learning model to analyze health data and predict the risk of heart disease.
The model is trained using relevant medical data and provides a high accuracy rate.
Diabetes Prediction:

Employs a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on user input.
Standardized data processing ensures reliable predictions.
Parkinson's Disease Prediction:

Uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to assess the risk of Parkinson's disease.
Incorporates feature scaling for enhanced model performance.
Technical Details
Machine Learning Models:

Heart Disease: Random Forest Classifier trained on medical datasets.
Diabetes: Logistic Regression model with standardized input data.
Parkinson's Disease: SVM with linear kernel, combined with data standardization.
Framework:

Flask: Used for developing the web application, handling requests, and rendering templates.
Data Preprocessing:

StandardScaler from scikit-learn is used to normalize the input features for consistent model performance.
Data is split into training and testing sets to validate the accuracy and reliability of the models.
How It Works
User Input:

Users enter their health data through a user-friendly interface.
Data Processing:

The input data is preprocessed and standardized.
Prediction:

The preprocessed data is fed into the corresponding machine learning model.
The model predicts the likelihood of the disease.
Results:

The prediction results are displayed to the user, indicating whether they are at risk.
